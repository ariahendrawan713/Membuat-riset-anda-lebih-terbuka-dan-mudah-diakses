Why have open access to publications and data in Horizon 2020?

Modern research builds on extensive scientific dialogue and advances by improving
earlier work. The Europe 2020 strategy for a smart, sustainable and inclusive
economy underlines the central role of knowledge and innovation in generating
growth. Broader access to scientific publications and data therefore helps to:

* build on previous research results (improved quality of results)
* encourage collaboration and avoid duplication of effort (greater efficiency)
* speed up innovation (faster progress to market means faster growth)
* involve citizens and society (improved transparency of the scientific process).

This is why the EU wants to improve access to scientific information and to boost the
benefits of public investment in research funded under Horizon 2020.

The Commission considers that there should be no need to pay for information
funded from the public purse each time it is accessed or used. Moreover, it should
benefit European businesses and the public to the full.

This means making publicly-funded scientific information available online, at no
extra cost, to European researchers, innovative industries and the public, while
ensuring that it is preserved in the long term.

Under Horizon 2020, the legal basis for open access is laid down in the Framework
Programme and its Rules for Participation. These principles are translated into
specific requirements in the Model Grant Agreement and in the Horizon 2020 work
programmes.

The Annotated Model Grant Agreement provides specific explanations of the Model
Grant Agreement. These guidelines build on these documents.
